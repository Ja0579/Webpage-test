          <h3>Delicious</h3>
          <p class="middle-skills">FUJI apples are an excellent source of fiber to regulate the digestive tract and vitamin C to strengthen the immune system, reduce inflammation, and boost collagen production. The apples also provide potassium to balance fluid levels within the body, calcium and phosphorus to protect bones and teeth, vitamin E to guard the cells against free radical damage, and other amounts of magnesium, zinc, iron, copper, and vitamin A. </p>

          <h3>Sweet and juicy</h3>
          <p>FUJI apples are a medium to large varietal, averaging 7 to 8 centimeters in diameter, and have an oval to conical appearance, tapering slightly at the fruit’s base. The skin is thin, tender, smooth, and has a yellow-green base, overlaid with a dark red-orange blush. The surface also features a unique dimpled texture and prominent pale-yellow lenticels. Underneath the skin, the pale yellow to ivory flesh is dense and crunchy, composed of larger cells, giving the flesh a snapping, cracking consistency. FUJI apples feel heavy for their size and are known for their aqueous nature. The flesh also contains high sugar content with acidity, creating a balanced, sweet-tart flavor. The taste is initially sweet and tangy with a sharp but not overpowering zest, dissipating quickly to a pleasant, sweet aftertaste. </p>
